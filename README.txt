Overview
========

Punchy is based on Pithy. At runtime it minifies and combines javascript and css files
into pre-configured bundles. It uses a plugin system so that minification engines can
be exchanged. Microsoft Ajax Minifier and Yahoo! YUI Compressor are included.

Punchy requires that a folder within your web application be writable by the application.
